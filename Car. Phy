The previous program already uses the __init__ method to initialize the attributes. However, here's the same code with a clearer explanation:

class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        """Initialize the Car object with brand and model attributes."""
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def display_info(self):
        """Display the car's brand and model."""
        print(f"Car Brand: {self.brand}, Model: {self.model}")

# Example usage
my_car = Car("Honda", "Civic")
my_car.display_info()

Explanation:

The __init__ method is a constructor that initializes the brand and model attributes when an object is created.

The display_info method prints the car's details.

An instance of Car (my_car) is created with "Honda" as the brand and "Civic" as the model, then the details are displayed.
