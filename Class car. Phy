Here's a Python program that creates multiple objects of the Car class with different attributes and displays their details:

class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        """Initialize the Car object with brand and model attributes."""
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def display_info(self):
        """Display the car's brand and model."""
        print(f"Car Brand: {self.brand}, Model: {self.model}")

# Creating multiple Car objects
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
car2 = Car("Honda", "Civic")
car3 = Car("Ford", "Mustang")

# Displaying details of each car
car1.display_info()
car2.display_info()
car3.display_info()

Output:

Car Brand: Toyota, Model: Corolla
Car Brand: Honda, Model: Civic
Car Brand: Ford, Model: Mustang

Explanation:

The Car class has an __init__ method to initialize the brand and model attributes.

Three objects (car1, car2, and car3) are created with different attributes.

The display_info method is called for each object to print their details.
