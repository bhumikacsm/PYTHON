Here's a simple Python program that defines a Car class with attributes brand and model, along with a method to display these attributes:

class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Car Brand: {self.brand}, Model: {self.model}")

# Example usage
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
my_car.display_info()

Explanation:

The __init__ method initializes the brand and model attributes.

The display_info method prints the car's details.

The example usage creates a Car object with "Toyota" as the brand and "Corolla" as the model, then displays the details.
